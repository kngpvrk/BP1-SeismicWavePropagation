## üìù Introduction and Background 

This code simulates two-dimensional seismic wave propagation in an elastic homogeneous medium by employing numerical modeling to analyze wave behavior in a geophysical setting. 
Furthermore, it computes displacement time series at the surface and constructs synthetic seismograms for stations located at varying distances from the source. 
It also identifies the peaks of P- and S-wave arrival times and calculates their velocities based on the seismograms, comparing them with theoretical values.


This code was developed in the context of "BWp1 Geophysical Methods: Introduction to Geophysical Project Work", a bachelor module in geoscience at the Goethe University Frankfurt, Germany.







### Programming Tools 

The programming language *Julia* and the *Visual Studio Code editor* were utilized for this purpose. For the visualization, the Julia package *Plots* and *Pyplot*
were used to create graphical plots of the simulation results, while the *Measure* package allowed the customization of the plot layouts.

### Core Equations

This project is based on several fundamental equations that describe seismic wave propagation in an elastic medium. Among these, the two most important ones are the wave velocity equations and the force balance equation. 

1. **Wave Velocities**: The theoretical velocities of P- and S-waves are calculated using the following equations. Here, `K` is the bulk modulus, `G` the shear modulus and `œÅ` the density of the medium.

$$
v_p = \sqrt{\frac{K + \frac{4}{3}G}{\rho}}
$$

$$
v_s = \sqrt{\frac{G}{\rho}}
$$


2. **Force Balance**: In a two-dimensional continuum, addressing changes in the x and y directions, the force balance is given as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\rho \frac{\partial v_x}{\partial t} &= \frac{\partial \tau_{xx}}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial \tau_{xy}}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial P}{\partial x}, \\
\rho \frac{\partial v_y}{\partial t} &= \frac{\partial \tau_{yy}}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial \tau_{xy}}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial P}{\partial y}
\end{aligned}
$$


This equation describes the state of a medium under the influence of external forces and stresses. The terms `œÅ ‚àÇvx/‚àÇt` and `œÅ ‚àÇvy/‚àÇt` describe the change in velocity with time at a point in the medium in the `x`- or `y`-direction, where `œÅ` is the density of the medium. 
The gradients of the normal stresses, `‚àÇœÑxx/‚àÇx` and `‚àÇœÑyy/‚àÇy` represent the forces resulting from the extension or compression of the material in the `x`- or `y`-direction. The shear stress is represented by the terms `‚àÇœÑxy/‚àÇy` and `‚àÇœÑxy/‚àÇx` in the `x`- or `y`-direction. 
The pressure gradients, `‚àÇP/‚àÇx` and `‚àÇP/‚àÇy` describe the effect of pressure on the medium in the `x`- or `y`-direction.



Other equations, such as the stress-strain relationships, total stress tensor, strain, shear deformation, Gaussian function, time displacement, and others, are implemented in the code but are not detailed here for brevity. For more detailed explanations, see the works of Chapman (2004), Achenbach (2012), and Bormann et al. (2012) listed in the [References](#references).

### Finite Element Method 

The *finite element method* (FEM) was utilized for the modeling of seismic wave propagation, which allowed the division of the system into discrete
parts, enabling continuous physical equations to be solved numerically.  

### Boundary Conditions

In this project, the *Neuman Boundary Conditions* were applied to define the behavior at the edges of the local domain. These conditions ensure 
zero particle velocity across the edges, and as a result, confine the wavefield within the domain. 


### Initialization of Wave Propagation

The *Gaussian function* was employed to represent a localized disturbance in terms of pressure (P) and stress (œÑ). This function simulates a disturbance with an energy 
source that is both localized and smoothly distributed.


### Time Integration

The 'Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL)' condition is used, which is a stability criterion for numerical simulations of partial differential equations. By keeping the 
appropriate ratio of the time step to the spatial resolution, it prevents the numerical solution from becoming unstable as it exceeds the relation of order 
of system‚Äôs maximum wave speed.


### Synthetic Seismograms

The finite-difference method was employed to update the wave equation velocities and stresses at each time step. At each iteration, values were calculated for every grid cell as time progressed. The average horizontal velocity was then extracted from the grid cell closest to the station. Instantaneous displacements were computed by multiplying the velocity by the time step and then stored in arrays, which are used to produce the synthetic seismogram.

The seismogram displacement array is scanned to identify when the displacement exceeds a defined limit. That moment is labeled as the corresponding wave‚Äôs arrival time. Since P-waves travel faster, they exceed the limit earlier than S‚Äìwaves. Therefore, the P‚Äì and S‚Äìwaves must be identified separately. Ideally, the first peak in the seismogram corresponds to the P-wave, while the second peak represents the S‚Äìwave. Based on the distance from the source to each station and the arrival times of the P‚Äì and S‚Äìwaves, the wave velocities at each station can be computed. 

## üî∂ Limitations 

While this simulation successfully demonstrates the propagation of elastic seismic waves in a simplified, homogeneous domain, it has many limitations:

- Numerical artifacts such as distorted wave velocities and arrival times are introduced by numerical dispersion, coarse grid resolution,
  and reflective boundaries.
- Simplistic assumptions of a homogeneous elastic medium oversimplify the real-world geology and therefore doesn't account for heterogeneities, anisotropy, and layering.
- Restriction to two dimensions limits application to real-world seismic events, which occur in three dimensions.

 Despite these limitations, the simulation offers a valuable framework for understanding seismic wave behavior under idealized conditions. 

 ## üî® Getting Started 
 ### General Requirements
 To run the code, ensure following tools are installed:

- **Julia**: Version 1.11 or higher ([Click here to Download Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/))
- **Code Editor**: Visual Studio Code (recommended) ([Download VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
- **Git**: Required for cloning the repository ([Click here to Download Git](https://git-scm.com/))
- **Code Editor**: For example Visual Studio Code ([Download VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

Run the following lines in Julia REPL to install the necessary packages:

```
using Pkg
Pkg.add(["Plots", "PyPlot", "Measures"])
```


### Setting up the Project and Running the Code

To start setting up the project, create a new directory where you want to store the project and initialize the project by cloning this repository. Then open your terminal and execute the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/kngpvrk/BP1-SeismicWavePropagation.git
BP1-SeismicWavePropagation
```

The last step is to execute the code by running the following line in the Julia REPL: 

```
include("BWp1_Trapp_code.jl")
```


The simulation uses default parameters, which can be modified directly in the script:
- Domain size: 80 x 30 km (xmin, xmax = 0, 80e3 | ymin, ymax = -30e3, 8)
- Grid resolution: ncx, ncy = 400, 250
- Bulk modulus: K = 5e10 Pa
- Shear modulus: G = 3e10 Pa
- Density: œÅ = 2700 kg/m¬≥
- Distance of surface stations from source: Station 1 = 20 km, Station 2 = 40 km (xst1, yst1 = 20e3, 0.0 | xst2, yst2 = 40e3, 0.0)


## üîç Results

The simulation generates:
- Visualiazation of Wave Propagation: A heatmap illustrates the velocity magnitdue over time across the domain. The images are saved every 100th time step in a PNG format.
- Synthetic Seismograms: Records the displacement time series at the surface stations.
- Theoretical velocities of the P- and S-waves.
- Arrival Times of the P- and S-waves: Extracts the arrival times from the seismogram.
- Measured velocities of the P- and S-waves: Determines the measured velocities from the seismogram.


The following outputs can be gained using the default parameters:

|           | P-wave Velocity (km/s) | S-wave Velocity (km/s) | P-wave Arrival Time (s) | S-wave Arrival Time (s) |
|-----------|-------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| Theoretical | 5.774                 | 3.333                 | -                        | -                        |
| Station 1 | 6.114                 | 5.223                | 5.897                 | 6.903                 |
| Station 2 | 6.032                 | 5.379                | 8.289                 | 9.295                  |


### Occurring Discrepancies
The simulation revealed discrepancies between the theoretical and measured velocities, particularly for the S-waves. Furthermore, there is a significant discrepancy between the measured arrival times of the S-waves and those visually determined from the seismogram. These discrepancies primarily arise due to the limiting factors mentioned above and suggest that the method for identifying the S-wave-peak may be unsuitable for this kind of setup. Furthermore, the synthetic seismogram reveals additional issues, including significant oscillations around the zero displacement and sudden anomalies at certain time steps.  This is due to the use of instantaneous displacement instead of an accumulating one, as well as the presence of the mentioned limiting factors.


A visual analysis of the synthetic seismogram is recommended for validating the measured values, as it can provide a more accurate determination of wave velocities and arrival times.

The obtained values and results should always be critically reviewed, evaluated, and compared with literature to ensure their validity.
